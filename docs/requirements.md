### Requirements 

There are two subway stations with turnstiles of different types. First station has a uni-directional turnstile, which works only for passenger entry. The second station has a bi-directional turnstile - you can enter and exit through it. The passage to the metro through the turnstile is carried out on the card, which is arranged as a wallet: you can top up an unlimited amount. The cost of the passage is 30 RUB. The turnstile lets a person through if they have paid for entry or want to exit through a bi-directional turnstile. You can't exit through the unidirectional turnstile. Write a program in PHP for the operation of these turnstiles.
